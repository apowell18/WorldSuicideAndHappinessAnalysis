There seems to be little correlation between worldwide happiness and suicide rates. Finland was ranked the highest in the Happiest Country, whereas Afghanistan was ranked the lowest. Lesotho was ranked the highest in suicidal rates and Antigua/Barbuda had the lowest suicidal ratings. When comparing the Female and Male suicidal rates, I noticed that the male suicidal rates were significantly higher.
